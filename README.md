# Wordle Solver SS üéÆüîç

> **Screenshot Solver** - An intelligent Wordle assistant that uses computer vision and information theory to suggest optimal next guesses.

## Overview

**Wordle Solver SS** is a web application that helps solve Wordle puzzles by analyzing game screenshots or manual input. Using OpenCV for image processing, Tesseract for OCR, and information theory for word selection, it provides mathematically optimal word suggestions to help you maintain your Wordle streak.

### Key Capabilities

- **Screenshot Analysis**: Upload a Wordle screenshot and automatically extract the game state
- **Manual Grid Entry**: Type letters and cycle colors with a click-based interface
- **Intelligent Suggestions**: Uses entropy calculations to rank words by information gain
- **Dual Mode Support**: Works with both dark mode and light mode Wordle screenshots
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant suggestions after grid submission

## Why This Project Exists

Wordle is a fantastic word puzzle game, but sometimes you need a little help. This project demonstrates practical applications of:

- Computer vision techniques (contour detection, perspective transformation)
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Information theory and entropy-based decision making
- Full-stack web development with image processing

It's also a fun way to explore how machines can "see" and interpret visual information, then apply mathematical reasoning to solve problems.

## How It Works

### Image Processing Pipeline

1. **Image Upload & Validation**
   - User uploads a Wordle screenshot
   - File is validated for type and size
   - Image is decoded to an ImageBitmap for processing

2. **Grid Detection**
   - OpenCV analyzes the image for contours
   - Identifies rectangular shapes matching Wordle grid proportions
   - Filters candidates by aspect ratio and area

3. **Perspective Correction**
   - Four corner points of the grid are identified
   - Perspective transformation warps the grid to a perfect rectangle
   - Output is a normalized 6√ó5 tile grid

4. **Tile Extraction**
   - Warped grid is divided into 30 individual tiles
   - Each tile is cropped and preprocessed for analysis

5. **Color Classification**
   - Tiles are converted to HSV color space
   - Mean HSV values are compared to reference centroids
   - Colors are classified as green, yellow, or gray

6. **OCR Processing**
   - Each tile undergoes preprocessing:
     - Border cropping
     - Grayscale conversion
     - Gaussian blur for noise reduction
     - Binary thresholding (OTSU method)
     - Morphological operations (dilation, closing)
   - Tesseract performs single-character recognition
   - Results are validated and post-processed

7. **Entropy Calculation**
   - Current game state is analyzed
   - Each candidate word is evaluated for information gain
   - Entropy scores are calculated based on how much each guess narrows down possible answers
   - Words are ranked by entropy (higher = better)

8. **Results Display**
   - Top suggestions are shown with ranking
   - Additional suggestions available via "View More" button
   - Metadata includes remaining possible words count

### Manual Entry Flow

1. **Letter Input**
   - Type letters using keyboard
   - Active cell advances automatically
   - Backspace to delete and move backwards

2. **Color Cycling**
   - Click any tile to cycle through colors: Gray ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Green
   - Row locking prevents editing completed rows until current row is filled

3. **Validation & Submission**
   - First row must be complete before solving
   - Incomplete rows with partial words are flagged
   - Valid grid state is sent to backend API

4. **API Processing**
   - Backend receives guesses in format: `[["word", "byygg"], ...]`
   - Solver filters possible words based on constraints
   - Top candidates are ranked by entropy and returned

## Usage

### Starting the Server

#### Recommended Method (launch.js)

```bash
npm run launch
```

- Starts server on port 3000 (or next available port)
- Serves files from project root
- Includes automatic port detection

#### Alternative Method (server.js)

```bash
npm start
```

- Starts server on port 3000
- Equivalent functionality to launch.js

#### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Enables hot-reload with nodemon
- Automatically restarts server on file changes
- Useful during development

### Using the Application

1. **Open your browser:**

    <http://localhost:3000>

2. **Screenshot Upload Method:**
   - Click "üì∑ Upload Screenshot" button
   - Select a Wordle screenshot from your device
   - Wait for automatic processing (5-10 seconds)
   - Grid populates automatically with detected letters and colors
   - Click "Solve" to get suggestions

3. **Manual Entry Method:**
   - Type letters directly into the grid using your keyboard
   - Click tiles to cycle colors: Gray ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Green
   - Arrow keys to navigate between cells
   - Click "Solve" when ready

4. **View Results:**
   - Results page shows top suggestions ranked by effectiveness
   - "View More Guesses" button expands to show additional options
   - Metadata shows remaining possible words count

## Algorithm Details

### Information Entropy

The solver uses Shannon entropy to measure information gain:

$$H(X) = -\sum_{x \in X} p(x) \log_2 p(x)$$

Where:

- `H(X)` = entropy of the guess
- `p(x)` = probability of a specific pattern occurring
- Higher entropy = more information gained

Each guess is evaluated against all remaining possible answers. The guess that maximizes expected information gain is ranked highest.

### Color Classification

Colors are classified using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space:

- **Green tiles**: H‚âà49-66, S‚âà89-98, V‚âà129-183
- **Yellow tiles**: H‚âà22, S‚âà124, V‚âà157-207
- **Gray tiles**: H‚âà85-114, S‚âà10-11, V‚âà65-146

Distance to reference centroids determines final classification using weighted Euclidean distance.

### OCR Preprocessing

To improve OCR accuracy, tiles undergo:

1. **Border cropping** (10px) - Removes tile borders
2. **Gaussian blur** (3√ó3 kernel) - Reduces noise
3. **Binary thresholding** (OTSU) - Converts to black/white
4. **Morphological dilation** (2√ó2 ellipse kernel) - Thickens letters
5. **Morphological closing** (3√ó3 ellipse kernel) - Fills gaps
6. **Upscaling** (2x) - Improves recognition

## Known Limitations

### Current Issues

- **OCR Accuracy**: Character 'O' sometimes misread as '0' (confidence threshold set to 30%)
- **Screenshot Quality**: Works best with high-resolution, well-lit screenshots
- **Perspective Limits**: Extreme angles (>45¬∞ rotation) may fail grid detection
- **Light Mode vs Dark Mode**: Dark mode screenshots generally produce better results

### Future Improvements

- Machine learning model for improved letter recognition
- Support for other games like Scrabble, etc.
- Historical tracking of solve patterns
